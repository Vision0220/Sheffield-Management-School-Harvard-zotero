# Sheffield-Management-School-Harvard-zotero
This is a third party(that is me) support for the [University of Sheffield Management School Harvard reference standard formation](https://www.librarydevelopment.group.shef.ac.uk/referencing/harvard.html) . In many cases(mainly the articles and books), this format performs the same as the exported formation of StarPlus. 

It's not guaranteed, and not officially certificated. If you want to use this, I would recommend you use StarPlus to check several citations before implementing this repository. 


## Example
### 1-Article
StarPlus version: Moorhead, G. and Montanari, J.R. (1986) ‘An Empirical Investigation of the Groupthink Phenomenon’, Human relations (New York), 39(5), pp. 399–410. doi:10.1177/001872678603900502.

this version: Moorhead, G. and Montanari, J.R. (1986), ‘An Empirical Investigation of the Groupthink Phenomenon’. Human Relations, 39(5), pp. 399–410.doi:10.1177/001872678603900502.

### 2-Book
StarPlus version:   Mowday, R.T., Porter, L.W. and Steers, R.M. (1982) Employee-organization linkages : the psychology of commitment, absenteeism and turnover. New York ; London: Academic Press.

this version: Mowday, R.T., Porter, L.W. and Steers, R.M. (1982), Employee–Organization Linkages. Elsevier.doi:10.1016/C2013-0-11207-X.

(this difference may be caused by different sources)

### 3-Book
StarPlus version: Wellins, R.S., Byham, W.C. and Wilson, J.M. (1991) Empowered teams : creating self-directed work groups that improve quality, productivity, and participation. San Francisco: Jossey-Bass.
